[**Live Demo 🚀**](https://atif-pathan.github.io/homepage/)

## 💡 Overview

This project is a dummy homepage intended for use as a portfolio site. It was created as part of The Odin Project's Advanced HTML and CSS course, with a focus on implementing key web development concepts such as `responsive design`, `animations`, and `accessibility` best practices.

## ✨ Key Features & Learnings

*   **📱 Responsive Design:**
    *   Implemented a fluid layout that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from mobile to large desktop displays.
    *   Utilized media queries 📐 to adjust the layout, typography, and component sizing for optimal viewing on various devices.
    *   Used `picture` element with `srcset` attribute for responsive images, loading appropriate image sizes based on screen width.

*   **♿ Accessibility:**
    *   Employed semantic HTML5 elements 🏷️ to provide a clear document structure and improve screen reader navigation.
    *   Ensured proper color contrast for readability and WCAG compliance.
    *   Added ARIA attributes (`aria-label`) 💬 to enhance the accessibility of interactive elements.

*   **💫 Animations:**
    *   Implemented subtle yet engaging animations using CSS transitions and transforms to enhance user interaction.
    *   Added a tilting card effect 🃏 to the project cards on hover to make them more engaging.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   HTML5
*   CSS3
*   JavaScript (for the card tilting effect)
*   FontAwesome (for icons)

##  🔮 Future Improvements

*   **⚙️ Dynamic Content :** Implement a database to dynamically update project cards instead of hardcoding.
*   **⚡ Performance:** Improve image performance through optimized formats and multiple resolutions.
*   **♿ Accessibility Audit:** Conduct a comprehensive accessibility audit and enhance keyboard navigation support.
